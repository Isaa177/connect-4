Game title: Connect 4

Brief explanation: Players choose yellow or red discs. They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs upwards, horizontally, or diagonally. Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win.

Game explanation: first a function called "enter a command" will be showned and you must type the word "move", afterwards a function called "which column" will appear and the user must pick a number in between 0-6, the user must take into consideration that only one disc can be placed by turn, the game preferably must be played by two players, after choosing the row a function called "enter a command" will appear and the player must type "print board", that being done a board will printed showing where the disc was placed by player 1.

All these steps must be repeated by the player number 2 and 1 consecutively until one of them connects 4 discs, of its own, one next to the other in a either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal  line, and would be considered winning.
